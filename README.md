# Corona_Predict
Predicts the probability of a person having COVID-19 using training dataset provided.

Coronaviruses are a family of hundreds of viruses that can cause fever, respiratory
problems, and sometimes gastrointestinal symptoms too. The 2019 novel
coronavirus is one of seven members of this family known to infect humans, and
the third in the past three decades to jump from animals to humans.

With a hope of controlling the epidemic, this machine learning problem is 
designed to cater the need of a prediction model
that can predict the probability of a person getting infected by covid-19.

Models Used:
1.Linear Regression
2.Logistic Regression
3.Naive Bayes
4.KNN
